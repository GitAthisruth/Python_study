The Mathematics of Neural Networks

 - A rigorous introduction to the mathematics of networks and backpropagation.


Derivatives - They are functions to get the rates of change of y w.r.t x / slope of the tangent line

Integration - finding the area under the curve

Derivatives and Integration are opposite to each other.
