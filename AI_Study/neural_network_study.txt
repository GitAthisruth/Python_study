The Mathematics of Neural Networks

 - A rigorous introduction to the mathematics of networks and backpropagation.


Derivatives - They are functions to get the rates of change of y w.r.t x / slope of the tangent line

Integration - finding the area under the curve

Derivatives and Integration are opposite to each other.


Five Concepts in Calculus



    1. Function Notation
    2. Linear Function
    3. Exponents
        - Rational Exponents
        - 
    4. Domain Range
        Interval vs Set Notation

    Interval Notation               Set Notation

    ( ) -> not inclusive             > , < 
    [ ] -> inclusive                 >= , <= 
    infinity, - infinity - They
    are always not inclusive.eg -  (-infinity,4]

    5. Composite Functions
        eg: f(g(x))


slope = m = rise/run = y2 - y1 / x2 - x1
