The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Actions speak louder than words.

Better late than never.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Haste makes waste.
Ignorance is bliss.
It takes two to tango.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
No pain, no gain.
Practice makes perfect.
The early bird catches the worm.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
Time flies when you're having fun.
Two heads are better than one.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Actions speak louder than words.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Blood is thicker than water.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Every rose has its thorn.
Good things come to those who wait.
Honesty is the best policy.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
If you can't beat them, join them.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Look before you leap.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
No news is good news.
Once bitten, twice shy.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Practice what you preach.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
The best things in life are free.
The cat's out of the bag.
The early bird catches the worm.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
There's no place like home.
Time flies when you're having fun.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
When it rains, it pours.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
A watched pot never boils.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Actions speak louder than words.
All good things must come to an end.
Beauty is only skin deep.
Better late than never.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.
Easy come, easy go.
Every dog has its day.
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
Give credit where credit is due.
Good things come to those who wait.
Haste makes waste.
He who laughs last laughs best.
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
If you want something done right, do it yourself.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
It takes two to tango.
Let bygones be bygones.
Laughter is the best medicine.
Like father, like son.
Look before you leap.
Misery loves company.
Money can't buy happiness.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
No man is an island.
No pain, no gain.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Patience is a virtue.
Practice makes perfect.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
The early bird catches the worm.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
