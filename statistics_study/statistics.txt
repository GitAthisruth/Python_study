Statistics (link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxpc-HPKN28)

- It is the study of how to collect, organize, analyze, and interpret numerical information and data.
- It is both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting information from data.

- It is used to help us make decisions. This is especially important in health care and public health.



Example:CDC & the Flu Vaccine

- During the year, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects,organizes,analyzes, and interprets numerical information and data.

- They extract information from the data and make decisions about what to include in next year's flu vaccine.


Individuals & Variables

Meaning Outside statistics

- Individuals are people.
    - We expect 50 individuals at the graduation.
- A variable is a factor that can vary, possible causing a problem.

    - The time the shop takes with my car is an unknown variable,and i cannot predict it.

eg:time

Meaning in Statistics

- Individuals are people or objects included in a study.
    - 5 individuals could be 5 people,
      5 records, or 5 reports.

- A variable is a characteristic of the individual to be measured or observed.

    - The age of an individual person.
    - The time an individual record was entered.
    - The diagnosis listed on an individual report.


A Few Examples

Individual                               Variables

-Baby born to a mother who              -Birthweight
 smokes cigarettes.
-Urban city                             -Rate of overdose deaths



Concepts in Statistics

- Statistics is used in healthcare and other disciplines to help aid in decision-making.
- Understanding statistics is necessary to understand certain processes in healthcare.


Population Parameter and Sample Statistic


Parameters vs. Statistics

 - What is a population and and what is a sample?
 - Difference between population and sample data
 - Population parameters and sample statistics
 - Examples of parameters and statistics 


 What is a Population?

 Definition

 - A population is a group of people or objects with a common theme.

 - When every member of that group is considered, it is a population.


 Example

 - Theme: Nurses who work at ABC General Hospital(MGH)
 - Population: List from Human Resources of every currently employed nurse at MGH. 

 What is a Sample?

 Definition

 - A sample is a small portion of the population.

 - It can be a representative sample.

 - But it can also be a biased sample.


 Example 

 - Only survey ICU nurses at ABC MGH.
     Not a representative sample
 - At least one nurse from each department.
    - More representative sample.


Population vs Sample data

Population data

- In Population data, data from every individual in the population is available.

- Entire population = census.


Sample data

- In sample data, data is only available from some of the individuals in the population.
- Very commonly used in research studies of patients. 


Examples of Population Data

- Medicare(people age 65 and above are in medicare) Claims Dataset 
    - has all the insurance claims filed by Medicare population.

- United States Census  (conducted every 10 years)


Examples of Sample Data


- The Medicare Beneficiary Survey(MBS) is a survey of a sample of individuals on Medicare.
- American Community Survey(ACS) conducted yearly by the United States Census Bureau.



Statistical Notation


Total Population - N 

Sample of Population - n


Parameter vs. Statistic

A parameter is a measure that describes the entire population.

A statistic is a measure that describes only a sample of a population.


Examples of Parameters & Statistics

Parameter                                      Statistics
                                                
-Mean age of every American on                 - Mean age of Americans on Medicare estimated using the MBS
 Medicare

-The proportion of Americans addicted to       - The proportion of Americans in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) who admit they are addicted to cigarettes.
 cigarettes

-Actual voter turnout                          - The proportion of people in opinion polls who say they plan to vote.




Don't Get Confused!

- When you hear a number on the televisionor radio - do they mention if it is a population parameter or a sample statistic?
- Clues that the number is a population parameter:
  - A dataset was used that encompasses the entire population (like Medicare)
  - Analyses were done by the government or on behalf of the government.

- Clues that number is about a sample statistic:
  - It was from a study recruiting volunteers
  - The report mentions only surveying or measuring a sample of individuals. 

Parameter-Anything that we measure from a population is called parameter.

Statistic-Anything that we measure from a sample is called statistic.




Describing vs. Inferring

Descriptive statistics
- Descriptive statistics involve methods of organizing , picturing, and summarizing information from samples and populations.

Inferential statistics
- Inferential statistics involves methods of using information from a sample to draw conclusions regarding the population.
- Can only used with sample data

Parameters vs. Statistics

- In statistics, it is important to properly identify measures as population parameters or sample statistics.

- Different types of data are used for parameters and statistics.



Classifying Levels of Measurement(Four-level system)


Classifying Variables 

 - Quantitative vs. qualitative(categorical) data

    - Interval vs. ratio data
    - Nominal vs. ordinal data

 -  Examples of how to classify healthcare data


Four-level Data Classification

 (Human Research Data)

Quantitative(Continuous)  vs     Qualitative(categorical)


Quantitative(Continuous)

 - Quantitative is a numerical measurement of something.eg:temperature

 Examples of Quantitative Variables in Healthcare:

  - Time of admit

  - Year of diagnosis

  - Systolic blood pressure(SBP)

  - Platelet count

We can split  Quantitative data into:
 - Interval vs. Ratio 


 Interval 

 - Quantitative(continuous) data
    -Differences between data values are meaningful.

    - There is no true zero.
      - Interval = there is no true zero.
        - "Time" cannot have a true zero
            - Time of admit = 8:09 
            - Year of diagnosis = 1999

 Ratio 

  - Quantitative(continuous) data

  - Differences between data values are meaningful

  - There is a true zero. 

    - Ratio = there is a true zero.
        - if you are dead, you have a SBP(Systolic blood pressure) = 0
        - Same is true with platelet count







Qualitative(categorical)

- Qualitative refers to a "quality" or categorical characteristics of something eg:gender.

 Examples of Qualitative Variables in Healthcare:

  - Type of health insurance

  - Country of origin 

  - Stage of cancer

  - Trauma center level

   - Nominal = Cannot be ordered 

   - Ordinal = natural order 
     - Differences between levels is meaningless

We can split  Qualitative data into:
 - Nominal vs. ordinal


 Nominal 

  - Nominal applies to categories,labels or names, and cannot be ordered from smallest to largest.

   eg: country ,gender , race, hair color

Ordinal

  - Ordinal applies to data that can be arranged in order in categories,

    - but the difference between data values cannot be determined, or is meaningless.

    eg: ordinal data includes having a position in class as "First" or "Second".



Classifying Variables

 - All data can be classified as quantitative(continuous) or qualitative(categorical).

 - Data can be further classified as interval,ratio,nominal, or ordinal.

 - It is important to know how to classify data in healthcare.



Sampling 


Sampling Definition

Concepts in Sampling

 - What is a "sample"?

 - Sampling frames, and errors in representing sampling frames.

 - Summary of definitions presented.
   

Sampling and Samples 

 - We take a sample of the population because we want to do "inferential statistics"
    - We want to infer from the sample to the population.

 - Reasons not to measure the whole population
    - Impractical 
    - Unnecessary


Sampling Frames

 - List of individuals from which a sample is actually selected.

 - "List" may be a physical,concrete listed
    - List of students enrolled at a nursing college

 - May be a theoretical list not made up yet
    - List of patients who will present to the Emergency Department today.


 - Sampling frame is the part of the population from which you want to draw a sample.

Therefore, you want everyone from your sampling frame to have a chance of being selected for your sample.



Undercoverage

What is it?

 - Omitting population members from the sampling frame(list of members in population used for sampling).

How can it happen?

 - List of nursing students may not include everyone for administrative reasons.

 - People who present to the Emergency Department at night might be different than those in the day.



Errors in Statistics

Fact-of-Life Error

 - Sampling errors

    - The population mean will probably be different from your sample mean.

    - The population percentage will probably be different from your sample percentage.


Cause of Error

 - Sampling error - caused by the fact that, regardless of what you do, your sample will not perfectly represent the population.


Error you want to Avoid

 - Non-sampling error
    - Using a bad list.
    - Make sure that you pay careful attention that everyone in the population who is supposed to be represented in your sampling frame is in there!

Cause of Error
 - Non-sampling error - caused by poor sample design, sloppy data collection, inaccurate measurement instruments, bias in data collection, other problems introduced by the researcher.


Simulation

 - A simulation is defined as a "numerical facsimile or representation of a real-world phenomenon."

 - It is a essentially working through a pretend situation to see how it would come out in the case it was real. 


Concepts in Sampling 

 - it is important to do your best to avoid non-sampling error

 - This is achieved by making sure you do not have undercoverage when sampling from your sampling frame.


Simple Random Sampling

Definition 

 - "A simple random sample of n measurements from a population is a subset of the population selected in such a manner that every sample of size n from the population has an equal chance of being selected".

Example

 - You have a list of the population of students in a class.

 - You want to take a sample of 5 (n=5).

 -  If you take a simple random sample (SRS) from the class list, it means all the different possible  groups of 5 students you could pick from the list has an equal chance of being the sample (group) you actually pick.



One method of SRS


 - Number all of the individuals in the population with a unique number.
    - Like student ID number

 - Put all the student ID numbers in a place from which you can draw randomly without looking(like a hat)

 - Draw 5 ID's and use those students as your sample.


Another method of SRS

    - Generate a list of random numbers as long as the list of the population.

    - Randomly assign these numbers to the population in the list.

    - Take the first 5 numbers(whoever gets assign 1 through 5).


SRS Means Equal Chance of Being selected

 - First method: old-fashioned "hat"
 - Second method: Electronic "hat"
 - In both methods, all members of the population had an equal probability of being selected into the sample.


Limits of Simple Random Sampling

  - You need a list
    - You don't know who will present at the Emergency Department that day, how do you sample?
    - Okay when a list is available.

  - You need a good list

    - Otherwise, you risk undercoverage
    - What if part-time  students were not on the list?
    - Non-sampling error



Stratified Sampling 


What is Stratified Sampling?

 - First, the list is divided into groups, or strata.

 - This is a way to make it so that there are certain proportions of groups in the final sample.

 - Next,simple random sampling(SRS) takes place for each of the strate.



Steps in Stratified Sampling

 - Divide entire population into distinct subgroups called strata.
 - The strata are based on a specific characteristic, such as age, income,education level, and so on.
 - All members of a stratum share this specific characteristic.
 - Draw an SRS from each stratum. 


Examples of Stratified Sampling

 - In a high school, sampling so many students from each of the grades(freshman,sophomore,junior,senior)

 - In hospitals, sampling so many patients or providers from department(different intensive care units).


Limitations of Stratified  Sampling

 - Oversampling one group(strata) means your summary statistic is unbalanced.

 - It is not possible to do without a list beforehand(like with SRS).

 - It is also hard because you have to split the list into groups("strata") then SRS from strata.


Stratified Sampling 

 - Stratified = taken from groups.
 - Several steps are involved.
 - Useful if necessary to make all strata equal, or to sample from groups that are small in the large population.


Systematic Sampling


 - Systematic sampling can be done with or without a list.

 - Systematic sampling is best described through the steps one takes to do it.

 - Just pick a random starting point, then pick every kth individual.
 


Steps in Systematic Sampling

1. Arrange all individuals of the population in a particular order.

2. Pick a random individual as a start.

3. Then take every kth member of the population in the sample.

    -"kth" means "every so many".


Examples of Systematic Sampling from a List

 - Take out a list of classes available next semester.

 - Pick arandom number that is small - like 3. Go to the third class.

 - Pick another random number - like 5. Pick every 5th class after that.


Characteristics of Systematic Sampling

 - You cannot do this when there is a pattern to the data (boy/girl/boy/girl).
 - You can do systematic sampling in a clinical setting, where you do not know who is going to come in that day.



Cluster Sampling

 - Cluster sampling is used when geography is important in sampling.

 - The map is divided into areas, and all the people in a particular area are sampled.

 - Biased toward type of people living in the area.



Why use Cluster Sampling?

 - The problem is localized to a particular location.

 - In cluster sampling, we begin by dividing the map in geographical areas.

 - Then we randomly pick clusters, or areas, from the map. We take all the people in the cluster. 


Problems with cluster Sampling

 - Sometimes, the people located in a cluster are all similar in a way that makes the problem hard to study.

 - If cancer rates are high all over the clusters, it's hard to see if a geographical location is causing higher rates.



Convenience & Multi-Stage Sampling

 - Avoid using convenience sampling unless the question is low risk.

 - Use if the only type of sampling possible under the circumstances.

 - Also used when resources are low.

 - Multi-stage sampling usually used in large, governmental studies.

 

Convenience Sampling

  - Convenience sampling can be used under low risk circumstances.

  - What ice cream is the best from the restaurant next to the hospital?

  - However, often results are not reliable.



What is Convenience Sampling?

 - Using results or data that are conveniently or readily obtained.

 - Can be useful if not a lot of resources allocated to the study.

 - Use an already-assembled group for surveys.

 - Ask patients in the waiting room to fill out a survey,or students in a class.


What are the Problems with Convenience Sampling?

 - There is a bias in every group.
 - Often miss important subpopulations(what stratified sampling addresses).
 - Results can be severely biased.


Multi-stage Sampling

 - Combination of sampling strategies layered in stages.

   - Example:
      - Stage 1: Cluster sample of states(two census regions).
      - Stage 2:Simple random sample of counties(from each state).
      - Stage 3:Stratified sample of schools(urban/rural).
      - Stage 4:Stratified sample of classrooms.

Learning Objectives

At the end of this lecture,the student should be able to:
 - State the steps of conducting a statistical study.
 - Select one step of developing a statistical study, and state the reason for this step.
 - Name one common mistake that can introduce bias into a survey,and give an example.
 - Explain what a lurking variable is, and give an example.
 - Define what a completely randomized experiment is. 


Introduction

 - Steps to Conducting Statistical Study.
 - Basic Terms & definitions
 - Avoiding Bias in Survey Design
 - Topics in Randomization.



Basic Terms & Definitions

 
Basic Guidelines for Planning a Statistical Study

1. State a hypothesis.
2. Identify the individuals of interest.
3. Specify the variables to measure.
4. Determine if you will use the entire population or a sample.
   -if you choose a sample, choose a sampling method
5. Address ethical concerns before data collection.
6. Collect the data.
7. Use descriptive or inferential statistics to answer your hypothesis.
8. Note any concerns about your data collection or analysis.
   - Make recommendations for future studies.



Hypothesis & Variables

 - Hypothesis: Air pollution causes asthma in children who live in urban setting.
 - Individuals: Children in urban settings
 - Variables: Air pollution and asthma.


Sampling,Ethics & Data collection

  - Either collect data or use existing dataset
     - Can use a government dataset for population measures.
  - Can collect data from a sample for estimates
     - Need to choose sampling approach
     - Will need consent if legally found to be "human research"
     - May need consent from parents to collect data about children. 


Census vs. Sample

In a census, measurements or observations from the entire population are used.

In a sample,measurements or observations from part of the population are used.



Experiment vs. Observational Study

Experiment
  - A treatment or intervention is deliberately assigned to the individuals.
  - The purpose is to study the possible effect of the treatment or intervention on the variables measured.

Observational Study

 - Observations and measurements of individuals are taken.
 - However, no treatment or intervention is assigned by the researcher.


Replication

 - Studies must be done rigorously enough to be replicated.
 - Replicating the results of observational studies and experiments is necessary for science to progress.

 
Avoiding Bias in Survey Describing

Bias

 - Surveys can provide a lot of useful information.
 - However,it is important that all aspects of survey design and administration minimize "bias"
 - Several considerations should be made.



Non-response & Voluntary response

 - If many people refuse your survey, the people who do complete it are likely to have a biased opinion.
 - There may be a reason they do not complete your survey that has to do with how they feel about your survey topic.



Truthfulness of Response

 - Respondents may lie on purpose
    - if asked a question that is too personal
    - if asked a question too hard to think about
 - Respondents may lie inadvertently
    - May not remember if asking about something that happened a long time ago
 - May have "recall bias" influenced by events that have happened since original event.


Hidden Bias

 - Question wording may induce a certain response.
    - How long have you been using software A?
 - Order of questions and other wording may induce a certain response.
    - Do you agree with Obamacare?
    - More people have health insurance than ever before. Do you agree with Obamacare?
 - Scales of questions may not accurately measure responses
    - Do your feelings always fit on a scale 1 to 5?

Interviewer Influence 

  - This is important with in person and phone surveys.
  - Best to have interviewer from same population as research participant.
  - All verbal and non-verbal influences matter.

Vague wording

 - Avoid vague terms used in a survey.
    - Instead of asking if a person waited "a long time" in the waiting room,ask the number of minutes.
 - If you must  use vague terms, include grounding language.
    - Where 10 is extremely important, and 1 is not at all important, how important is having a controllable lifestyle to you in your future career?A controllable lifestyle is defined as one that allows the physician to control the number of hours devoted to practicing his/her specialty.


Lurking Variable

 - "Lurk" means to sneak around behind the scenes.
 - A "lurking variable" is a variable that is associated with a condition,but may not cause that condition.
 - For example, we know that having more education increases income. However, people of the same education  level do not all make the same income.
 - Lurking variables are sex and race. In the US, according to the Department of Labor, these variables can decrease a person's income at the same level of education.


Randomization


Why Randomize?

- Randomization is used to assign individuals to treatment groups.

- This helps prevent bias in selecting members for each group.
   -It distributes "lurking variables" evenly


A Completely Randomized Experiment

   -Recruit sample --> Measure confounders,
                        outcome


Blocked Randomization

 - If you want men and women equal in two randomized groups, create "blocks" with two slots - one for a man, and one for a woman.

 - As people come in and enroll in the study and you measure them, assign them to blocks.

 - Then, randomize the blocks. You will get a paired couples in each group!

Blinding 

 - Blinding is where a person (participant,research staff) is deliberately not told of a treatment assignment in a study so s/he is not biased in reporting study information.
      - Example: A participant is blinded to treatment or placebo.
      - Example: A study radiologist may be blinded to treatment group when looking at images during study procedures.

- Double-blind means study staff  and participant do not know treatment assignment.


Randomization & Bias

 - Randomization  is used  to reduce bias in an experiment.

 - Blocked randomization can even out groups.

 - Blinding further prevents bias.

 - The placebo effect is necessary to take into account.



Frequency Histograms & Distributions



Frequency Histograms

 - It's a specific type of bar chart made from data in a frequency table.
 - Frequency histograms and relative frequency histograms.
 - The purpose of the chart is to identify the "distribution" of the data.


Steps to Follow to Draw a Frequency Histograms

1. Make a frequency table.
2. Draw a vertical line for the y-axis. 
3. Write "Frequency of ____" along the y-axis.
4. Draw a horizontal line for the x-axis.
5.Write the classes below the x-axis and label them.
6. For the first class, find the frequency in the table. Look for it on the y-axis and draw a horozontal line.
7. Draw two vertical lines down to make a bar.
8. Repeat for all the other classes.
9. Color in the bars.


Relative Frequency Histogram

 - In the relative frequency histogram, the relative frequency goes on the y-axis.
 - The chart looks takes on a similar pattern.
 - Relative frequency better for comparing two populations or two samples.

 relative frequency = frequency/total no. of observations



- After making a frequency table, it is important to also make a frequency histogram and/or a relative frequency histogram.
- These are used to reveal the "distribution" in the data.


Distributions

 - It is the shape that is made if you draw a line along the edges of a histogram's bars.
 - A stem-and-leaf of the same data will make the same shape on its side.


5 Main Types of Distributions

1. Normal distribution(also called mount-shaped symmetrical)
2. Uniform distribution 
3. Skewed left distribution - left is small
4. Skewed right distribution -right is small
5. Bimodal distribution - two clearly seperate groups are visible in a histogram.It has two modes or two distict clusters of data.



Outliers 

 - Outliers are data values that are "very different" from other measurements in the dataset.



Cumulative Frequency

 - In "cumulative frequency" , you add up all the classes before the class you are on.
 - The first class is always the same as the frequency.
 - Each cumulative frequency is equal to or higher than the last one.
 


 Chart of Cumulative Frequency: Ogive

  - Classes along the x axis, and cumulative frequency along the y-axis.
  - Because cumulative frequency goes up from class to class , the Ogive line always goes up to the top frequency.




Time Series Graphs

 - Time series data are made of measurements for the same variable for the same individual taken at intervals over a period of time.
 - Stock market prices
 - Yearly rates of diseases such as influenza. 


How to plot a Time-Series Graph

1. Get time series data: one measurement per time period(month,year,etc.).
2. Draw a horizontal line for the x-axis. Label the time periods.
3. Draw a vertical line for the y-axis. Make sure it is tall enough for the highest data value. Label it.
4. Looking at your data, the x-axis, and the y-axis, put dots in where the data points are.
5. Connect the dots.
6. You can have more than one line on the graph for more than one set of data values,
but this requires a legend. 


- Time series graphs are useful for understanding trends over time.
- Graphing more than one set of time series data on one graph can help in comparing the differences between the data sets. 


Bar Graph

Features of a Bar Graph

1. Bars can be vertical or horizontal.
2. Are of uniform width and of uniform spacing.
3. Length of bars represent variables's frequency or percentage of occurence.
4. Same measurement scale used for each bar.
5. Includes title, bar labels, and scale labels on axis or actual values for each bar.



Bar Graph vs. Histogram: What's the Difference?

 - The frequency histogram and relative frequency histogram are "special cases" of a bar graph.
 - They are bar graphs that:
    - Must have classes of a quantitative variable on the x-axis.
    - Must have frequency or relative frequency on the y-axis.


Warning About Changing  the Scale 

 - Notice on the right side of the slide that the top number on the y-axis is 35.0.
 - The highest value we have is 29.1.
 - See what happens when we change the y-axis to having a maximum of 30.0 instead of 35.0.

 - With a taller y-axis, the differences between bars looks less dramatic.
 - Clustered means more than one bar is graphed for each category.
 - Also,look for the begining of the scale. Some do not start at zero, and then the bars do not start at zero.
 - Look for the squiggle.



Pareto Chart

 - The height of the bar indicates the frequency of an event.
 - Arranged left to right according to decreasing height.
 - Meant to graph frequencies of "problems"
 - Used more in engineering than in healthcare.




Bar Graph Summary 

 - Bar graphs must be made following a few rules.
 - Can be very helpful for visualizing and comparing quantitative and qualitative data.
 - Scales are important in bar graphs!
 - Pareto charts(graphs) not used much in healthcare.


Pie charts

 - Pie chart(also circle graph) used with counts of "mutually exclusive" frequencies.mutually exclusive-happens one result at a time.eg:head or tail.
 - Often made in graphing programs because difficult to do by hand.
 - Very common in healthcare.

 Features of a Pie Chart

  - Every individual must be put in only one category.
  - Can be quanlitative or quantitative variable.
  - If quantitative(continuous), put in classes and then graphed.


A Few Note on Pie Charts

 - Must be mutually exclusive categories.
   - "Favorite" color vs. "check the colors you like"
 - More informative to put % than frequency, but it is helpful to do both.
 - Always include title and legend. 


On All Graphs 

 - Provide a title
 - Label axes
 - Identify units of measure
 - Make the graph as clear as possible(think of font size,number of items graphed).




Choosing the Right Kind of Graph

Type of Graph                          Cases Where Graph is Useful

- Frequency Histogram                 - For quantitative data, when you want to see the distribution.
- Relative Frequency                  - For quantitative data, when you want to see the distribution.
  Histogram                             Also,good for comparing to other data.
- Stem-and-leaf Display               - For quantitative data,when you want to see the distribution.
                                        Easier to make by hand than histogram.
- Time series graph                   - For graphing a variable that changes over time and is measured at regular intervals.
- Bar graph                           - For quantitative or qualitative data, and for displaying frequency or percentage.
- Pareto chart                        - For frequencies of rare events in descending order.
- Pie Graph                           - For mutually-exclusive categories (quanlitative or quantitative).






Frequency Tables and Stem-and-leaf Displays



How to Organize All thess Numbers?

 - 60 patients were studied for the distance they needed to be transported in an ambulance.
 - The shortest transport(minimum) was 1 mile.
 - The longest transport(maximum) was 47 miles.
 - It's hard to just look at a pile of numbers...how do we understand these data?  



A Few Definition
 - Class: An interval in the data.
   - Example: Between 30 and 40 miles. 

 - Class limit: The lowest and highest value that can fit in a class.
   - Example: 30 would be the lower class limit,and 40 would be the upper class limit.

 - Class width: How wide the class is.
   - Example: Upper class limit (40) minus lower class limit (30) = 10,then add 1 = 11.
   - Example: 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40 = (40-30+1)11 numbers 


 - Frequency: How many values from the data fall in the class.
   - Example: How many patients were transported 30 to 40 miles.


Decide on classes

 - Classes should be the same width
 - Class width can be determined empirically
   - Example: Age 18-24, 24-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65 and older
 - Should be based on the scientific literature.


Class Width Formula

Formula                               Example
 - Calculate this number:              - From the miles, 47 - 1 = 46 
   maximum - minimum                   - If we want 6 classes,46/6 = 7.7
 - Divide this by the number           - We increase this up to 8.
   of classes desired.
 - Increase this to the next whole
   number.

 - A frequency table displays each class along with the frequency(number of data points) in each class.
 - Selecting arbitrary class limits can make the frequency table unbalanced.
 - But not following the scientific literature can make your results non-comparable


Example for Frequency Table

Data collection
- Glucose is measured in the blood and expressed in mg/100 ml.
- Glucose is a big molecule that should be cleared from the blood,especially if fasting.
- Blood glucose levels for a random sample of 70 women were recorded after a 12-hour fast. 


Be Careful!

- Make sure that all the data points are accounted for only  once in one of the classes.
- Make sure the classes cover all the data.
- Make sure the total of your classes adds up to the total data points!



Relative Frequency Table

- "Relative" = in relationship to the rest of the data.
- Frequency = f
- Total sample size = n
- Relative frequency = f/n
- Relative frequency is the proportion of the values that are in that class.
- Relative frequency is something very useful to put in a frequency table.
- It is easy to calculate - take each class frequency divided by total.



Frequency Tables

- Frequency tables are necessary for organizing quantitative data.
- Class width must be selected, and lower and upper class limits determined.
- Frequencies are then filled in.
- You can also include relative frequencies.



Stem-and-leaf

- In a stem and leaf, there is always a "stem"
- Leaves are then added to the stem as we tally up the length of the leaves.
- Making one will help  you understand the terminology.
- A stem and leaf is another way to organize quantitative data.
- A stem and leaf is easier to make than a frequency table and requires less preparation.
- Can help you put data in order to create a frequency table.

Example: Days since Referral

- Data from 42 patients who visited a primary care clinic and were referred to mental health wer collected.
- The number of days between the referral and their first mental health appointment was collected.



Building the Stem and Leaf




Organizing Quantitative Data

Frequency Table                                   Stem and Leaf

1. Need to set up classes,class widths            1. Do not need to set up classes or class widths
2. Need to count frequencies in each              2. No need to count. Can tally the data as you go through the list.
   class 
3. Lots of pre-calculations                       3. Quicker to do.


Good Idea!

- Leaf is "unordered" if numbers out of order.
- After making unordered version,order the leaves.
- Then it is easier to count them up for your frequency table-no matter what classes
- Or, make each "leaf" a "class".



Measures of Central Tendency


Central Tendency

- How much does the data have a tendency to go to the center?
- Can only be asked about quantitative data.
- Remember the distributions?


Measures of Central Tendency

- Modes
- Median
   - With odd number of values
   - With even number of values
- Mean
   - Trimmed mean
   - Weighted average 


Mode

- The value that occurs most frequently in the dataset is the mode.eg(1,2,3,4,5,5),mode-5
- It is possible to have no mode.eg(1,2,3,4,5,6),mode - no mode
- It is possible to have more than one mode.eg(1,2,3,4,5,5,2),mode - mode -2,5
- Can get confusing with a lot of numbers in a  short range - which is most numerous?
- Less confusing when scale is large
   - Systolic blood pressure
   - Platelet count



What Does the Mode Tell you?

- Not much
- The most "popular" answer
- The most common result
- Not used a lot in healthcare.



Median

- Median is the Center of the Data
- Every set of quantitative data can be sorted in order of lowest to highest.
- Sometimes there are repeats in the data.
- Sometimes there are outliers.
- Sometimes all the data values are almost the same.
- Even so,they can be arranged in order.
- The "median" is the number that is halfway. 


How to Find the Median
1. Order the data from smallest to largest
2. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle data value.
3. If there is an even number of values, the median is the sum of the middle two values divided by 2.


How to Find the Middle Number

- After arranging the values in order,you have an "ordered set".
- If there are an odd number of values(n) take n+1, and divide by 2.
  Count up that many, and that is the median.
- If there are an even number of values(n) take n+1, and divide by 2.
  The number will end in something 0.5. Sum numbers on either side of that position and divide by 2. 


What Does the Median Tell You?

- The 50th percentile of the data.
- The middle rank of the data.
- The median doesn't care much about the ends of the data. Outliers don't bother it.
- It is resistant. It is stable.


Mean,Trimmed Mean & Weighted average



Greek Letter Capital Sigma

- Whenever you see this, say in your head, "Sum of___"
- Sigma(x) is pronounced, "Sum of x"
- x's are the values in your data.
- Means "add up all the x's
- Another example:
   - sigma(xy)
   - "Sum of xy".
   - Means you must have a bunch of xy's and need to add them up.
- Sigma used a lot in statistics.


Formula for Mean
- sigma(x) = add up all the x's.
- n = number of values in your data.
- After summing up all the x's, you divide by n.(sum(x)/n)


Notation about Means 

Sample statistics

- If your mean comes from a sample, it is called x-bar.
- Use a lowercase n for sample size.

Population Parameters

- If your mean comes from a population,it is called mu.
- Use an uppercase N for population size.


Means vs. Medians 

Medians
- Very resistant  to outliers.
- Very stable

Means
- Not resistant to outliers.
- Not very stable.


Trimming the Mean

- A very high value or very low value(outliers) can really throw off the mean.
- This is not a problem with the median.
- One solution to make the mean more resistant is to "trim" data off each end so the outliers get cut off.
- If you trim,you have to be fair and trim the smae amount off each side.

How to make a 5% Trimmed Mean?
1. Figure out how many dat points you have. Then, figure out what 5% of them would be.
   - If ypu have 100 data points,5% would be 5 data points.
2. Put the data in order.
3. Remove 5% from the top and 5% from the bottom.
   - Remove the 5 top ones and the 5 bottom ones.
4. Now make the mean out of the remaining data.


Weighted Average 

- Sometimes, certain values should count more towards the mean than others.
- If homework is 10% of your grade, and quizzes are 20% of your grade, the quizzes count for more than the homework.
- You can arrange this by doing a weighted mean.

Example

- Homework worth 10% , quizzes worth 20%, and final worth 70%.
- You got an A(4.0) on homework, B + (3.5) on quizzes, and B(3.0) on final.
- Non-weighted average: (4+3.5+3)/3 = 3.5
- Weighted average: (4.0*0.1) + (3.5*0.2) + (3.0*0.7) = 3.2



Weighted Average Formula = sigma(xw)/sigma(w), w - weightage



Measures of Central Tendency  & Normal Distribution

- This is a normal distribution.
- Using these data, a person could determine:
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode
- They are all on top of each other(all are same value).
- Mean,Median,Mode are measures of central tendency.


Measures of Central Tendency  & Skewed Distribution

- Here are right and left skewed distributions.
- Note the relative positions of the following:
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode

Central Tendency - It is the tendency of the random variable to cluster around the mean,median or mode.

Measures of Variation


Variation

- How much does the data vary?
- Imagine two different classes with the same mean grade.
- Can we tell how consistent each class was internally in terms of grades from a measure of central tendency?


Measures of Variation

- Range
- Variance and Standard Deviation
   - Sample and population
- Coefficient of variation



Range

 - The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum value.
 - It is easy to calculate 
 - Don't forget to actually do the substraction.

   42 33 21 78 62

   - In the above data,78 is the maximum
   - 21 is the minimum
   - 78 minus 21 = 57
   - 57 is the range.

The Range is Not Very useful

- The range is not very useful for looking at variation because it just relies on two points.
- It's not stable or resistant.
- Therefore, other measures are used to look at variation typically.

   42 33 21 78 62
- We had a range of 78 minus 21 = 57
- We could just change these two numbers and get a totally different range.



Variance &  Standard Deviation

- They are friends because this is how you calculate them:
   1. First, calculate the variance.
   2. Then, take the square root of variance, and that is the standard deviation.
- "Variance"
   - How much the data vary.
   - Think: how well does the mean represent the spread of the data?
- "Standard deviation"
   - "Standard" - following a standard, same
   - "deviation" - like a deviated septum.How much data deviates around the mean.


Formulas  for Variance & Standard Deviation

 - The formulas for sample variance and sample standard deviation are different than those for population variance and population standard deviation.
   - We don't use the population ones that often
   - We will concentrate on how to use the sample ones.

- Two different ways of doing the formula(for both sample for population) - the "defining formula" and the "computational formula"
   - Both get the same results.
   - I dislike the "computational formula" because I get really confused.
   - Therefore, I will teach you the "defining formula"


Let's Look at Formulas

 Sample Defining Formulas

Sample variance = s^2 = sigma((x - x bar)^2)/ (n-1)

Sample standard deviation =   s =  root(sigma((x - x bar)^2)/ (n-1))


Sum of Squares 

- sigma(x-x bar)^2 is another way of saying sum of squares.
   - An easy way to explain this(what the "squares" are) is to show an example of how to calculate it.
   - Imagine a sample of 6 patients presented to the central lab.We asked them how many minutes they had to wait to get service, and got these numbers:
      2 3 3 8 10 10

   - Each measurement is an x. First,fill in the x's.
   - Fill in the sum(sigma) of the x's at the bottom.
   - To figure out Column II(x minus x-bar),the sample mean(x-bar) is needed.
   - 36/6 (n=6) = a mean of 6.
   - Now Column II can be filled in.
   - For Column III((x minus x-bar)^2), square each value in Column II. Those are the "squares".
   - At the bottom, add them up. That's the sum of squares.
   - Sum of squares = 70.

Sample variance = s^2 = sigma((x - x bar)^2)/ (n-1)

- Remember,the sample was from 6 patients.
- Therefore, n= 6
- n - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5

Sample variance = s^2 = 70/5 = 14
Sample standard deviation =   s = root(14)



Look at Formulas

Sample Defining Formulas

Sample variance = s^2 = sigma((x - x bar)^2)/ (n-1) 

Sample standard deviation =   s =  root(sigma((x - x bar)^2)/ (n-1))

Population variance = sigma^2 = sigma(x-mue)^2/N
Population standard deviation = sigma = root(sigma(x-mue)^2/N)



Coefficient  of Variation(For Comparisons)


- You will notice the word "coefficient" used a lot in statistics.
- Coefficient of Variation is CV for short.
- CV shows how much the sata varies compared to the mean.
- Always expressed in a %.

Sample CV = s(sd of sample)/x bar * 100
Population CV = sigma / mua * 100

      Patients: s = 3.74, x-bar = 6
      3.74/6 * 100 = 62%
 

CV is used for Comparison 
- CV is also called relative standard deviation.
- It's hard to explain with only one group of patients.
- CV has no units - so you could compare two different ways of measuring a lab value,for example.
- The CV is the measure of the spread of the data relative to the average of the data.
   - In the first sample,the s is only 50% of the mean.
   - In the second sample,the s is 62% of the mean.

   Other Patients: s = 4,x-bar = 8
      4/8 * 100 = 50%

   If variance increase comparing to mean then its more unstable.
   Less variance is good.


Chebyshev's Theorem


What Chebyshev Figured Out

- First , he started thinking like this:
   - If you have an x-bar and an s,you can create lower and upper limits by substracting the s and adding the s to the x-bar.
   - You can do this with a mue and sigma , too - population version.
- For example, if i had an mue of 100, and an sigma of 5:
   - If I substracted 1 sigma from 100,I'd get 95 as the lower limit.
   - If i add 1 sigma to 100,I get 105 as the upper limit.
   - I could even try this by doing 2 sigma - meaning substracting 10 for the lower limit and adding 10 for the upper limit.
- He realized if he used some rules along with this,there would be an interpretation of these limits that would be useful. 


Chebyshev's Theorem

- He figured out the upper and lower limits, when figured out this way,explained at least what % of the data would be between these limits in his dataset.
- He wanted this to work for all distributions,not just normal.
- He used a formula to figure out this % that was based on the s.He used "k" to mean the number of "s"'s(or "sigma"'s) in the equation:
   1-1/k^2 = % of data between x-bar minus k and x-bar plus k.

- Note: Chebyshev already did this,so you don't have to memorize this formula. This is just the proof.
- He used the following numbers for k:2,3 and 4.
- He got the following answers:
   - If you do x-bar (or mue) minus 2 s (or 2(sigma)) and x-bar (or mue) plus 2 s(or 2(sigma)),the % of data between the lower and upper limits is 75%.
      - If you plug 2 into the equation,you will get 75%.
   - For 3 s (or 3(sigma)),it is 89.9%
   - For 4 s (or 4(sigma)) it is 93.8%
- The space between the upper and lower limits is called the "Chebyshev Interval"

Example

Patient Sample(waiting room minutes) s = 3.74,x-bar = 6.
- Calculate limits for patient Sample
   - 75% limits:6 +/-(2*3.74) = -1.48 to 13.48
   - 88.9% limits:6 +/-(3*3.74) = -5.22 to 17.22
   - 93.8% limits:6 +/-(4*3.74) = -8.96 to 20.96

- Interpretation 
   - At least 75% of the data are between  -1.48 and 13.48
   - At least 88.9% of the data are between  -5.22 to 17.22
   - At least 93.8% of the data are between  -8.96 to 20.96

- It works for any distrubution (normal,skewed,etc)
- chebyshev intervals tell you that at least a certain % is in the interval.
- Chebyshev intervals are Sometimes non-sensical(negative numbers,very high limits)
- They are not very useful and not used in healthcare
- The purpose of teaching this is to point out in statistics,
 we often use the s or sigma and add/substract it from the mean because it is a good way to make lower and upper limits that have special significance.


Percentiles and  Box-and-Whisker Plots


Percentiles

- Quantitative data
- Remember standardized tests...
- Example: If you test at the 77th percentile,it means you did better than 77% of the people taking the test.
- If 100 people took the test,yoy'd have done better than 77 of them.



Percentile Definition

- Percentiles can be between 1 and 99.
   - You can't have a -2nd percentile, or a 105th percentile
- Whatever number you pick:
   - That % of values fall below the number.
   - And 100 minus that % of values fall above the number 
- Example:20 people take a test.
   - Let's say there is a maximum score of 5 on the test.
   - The 25th percentile means 25% of the scores fall below this score, and 75% fall above that score.
- Let's say it is an easy test, and 12 people get a 4,and the remaining 8 get a 5.The 25th percentile,or the score the cuts off the bottom 5 tests scores,will be 4.(Even the 50th percentile will be 4.)
- This would some out very different if it were a hard test,and most people got below a score of 3.


Quartiles and  Interquartile Range


Quartiles

- Quartiles is a specific set of percentiles
   - 1st quartile: 25th percentile
   - 2nd quartile: 50th percentile(also median)  
   - 3rd quartile: 75th percentile
- These can be calculated by hand.


Computing Quartiles

1. Order the data from smallest to largest.
2. Find the median.
   - 2nd quartile
   - 50th percentile
3. Find the median of the lower half of the data.
   - 1st quartile
   - 25th percentile
4. Find the median of the upper half of the data.
   - 3rd quartile
   - 75th percentile
- Remember the range?
- New! Interquartile range
- Once you have 3rd quartile and 1st quartile you can calculate interquartile range(IQR)
- 3rd quartile minus 1st quartile = IQR


Quartile Example

1. Order the data from smallest to largest.
2. Find the median. That's Quartile 2/50th percentile.
3. Find the median of the lower half of the data for Quartile 1/25th percentile.
4. Find the median of the upper half of the data for Quartile 3/75th percentile.

The following are a sample of numbers of beds from 11 Mass.hospitals(ordered)

   41 74 90 97 121 126 142 155 254 318 364

 126 = 50th percentile
 90 = 25th percentile
 254 = 75th percentile

IQR = 254 - 90 = 164 


More  Notes on Q1 and Q2

- Imagine we started with 6 values.
   - The median would be between the 3rd and 4th position.
   - Therefore, all 3 values below the median would be considered in calculating Q1, and all 3 above the median would be considered in calculating Q3.

   41 74 90 97 121 126

- What if we had 7 values instead of 6?
   - The median would be the 4th one in order. Because 7 is odd, the median then is not included in the lower or upper half of the data(used to calculate Q1 and Q3)
- Q1 would consider the 3 values below the 4th position, and Q3 would consider the 3 values above the 4th position, but the actual median in the 4th position(median) would not be considered.
   41 74 90 97 121 126 142



Box-and-Whisker Plot(Percentiles Graphed)


Box Plot Ingredients

Units: Hospital beds
Minimum = 41
Q1 = 90
Median(Q2) = 126
Q3 = 254
Maximum = 364

Let's make a box plot!

The following are a sample of numbers of beds from 11 Mass. hospitals(ordered)
   41 74 90 97 121 126 142 155 254 318 364
- Box representing the IQR
- Line inside the IQR Box is the median.
- Whiskers are the maximum and minimum values.


Why Box-and-Whisker Plots?

- Help see the distribution in the data.
- Another way to look at distribution.
   - Histogram
   - Stem-and-leaf
- Also can see spread of data


Scatter Diagrams and Linear Correlation

Scattegram(Scatterplot)

- Scattegrams Graph x,y Pairs

   - Explanatory(independent) variable is called x
      - Graphed on x-axis
- Respons(dependent) variable is called y
   - Graphed on y-axis
- Scatter diagram is a graph of these x,y pairs


Do the number of diagnoses a patient has correlate with the number of medications s/he takes?


Linear Cprrelation

- Linear correlation means that when you make a scatterplot of x,y pairs, it looks kind of like a line.
- "Perfect" linear correlation looks like graphing points in algebra.


Facts About Linear Correlation

- The line can go up. This is a positive correlation.
- The line can go down.This is negative correlation.
- The line can be straight.This is no correlation.
- The line can be goofy.
   This is also no correlation.

Correlation Has Two Attributes

Direction

- Positive correlation
- Negative correlation
- No correlation

Strength

- Strength refers to how close to the line all the dots fall.
- If they fall really close to the line, it is strong
- If they fall kind of close to the line, it is moderate
- If they aren't very close to the line,it's weak. 


Outliers in Correlation

- Outliers can have a very powerful effect on a correlation.
- An outlier in any of the 4 corners of the plot can really affect the direction of the line.
- An outlier can also change the correlation from strong and moderate to weak.
- It's good to look at a scatterplot to make sure you identify outliers.


Correlation Coefficient r

- Remember "coefficient" from CV (coefficient of variation or relative sd)?
- Coefficient just means a number
- r stands for the sample correlation coefficient
   - Remember! Correlation
   - Population correlation coefficient = P(raw)
   - We will only focus on r


What is r?

What it is

- A numerical quantification of how correlated a set of x,y pairs are
- Calculated from plugging x,y pairs into an equation 
- Has a defining formula and a computational formula
- I will demonstrate computational formula

How to interpret it

- The r calculation produces a number
- The lowest number possible is -1.0
   - Perfect negative correlation
- The highest possible number is 1.0
   - Perfect positive correlation
- All others are in-between


Calculating r


Computational Formula


r = n*sigma(x*y) - (sigma(x)*sigma(y))/root(n*sigma(x^2)) * root(n*sigma(y^2))-sigma(y)^2


Hypothetical Scenario

- We have 7 patients
- They have come to the clinic for appointments throughout the year.
- We predict those with a higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP) will have more appointments.
- We take DBP at last appointment as "x"
- We take number of appointments over the year as "y"

Opinion
For positive correlations:
- 0.0 to 0.40:Weak
- 0.40 to 0.70:Moderate
- 0.70 to 1.0:Strong


Facts About r

- r requires data with a "bivariate normal distribution" - we do not cover looking at this in this class,but please know this.
- r does not have units.
- Perfect linear correlation is r=-1.0 or r=1.0(depending on direction).
  No linear correlation is r=0.
- Positive r means as x goes up, y goes up,and as x goes down,y goes down.
- Negative r means as x goes up,y goes down,and as x goes down,y goes up.
- Even if you switched a and y on the axes,you'd get the same r.
- Even if you converted x and y to different units(e.g.,you converted measurements into the metric system),you'd get the same r.


Lurking Variables and "Correlation is not Causation"


Correlation is not Causation

   - Beware of lurking variables!
   - A lurking variable that influences both dependant and independant variable.  
   - Selecting x and y is political - you are implying x could cause y
      - Example: Taller people are heavier ,so x=height and y=weight
      - People who are overweight do not suddenly grow taller 
   - But there are other causes of weight besides height
   - Genetics can cause both height and weight.
      - A genetic profile that leads to tallness and obesity could be a lurking variable in the relationship between height and weight.
   



Examples 

Claims

- Eating ice cream causes murders,because when more ice cream is sold,murder rates rise.

Reality

- "Summer" and warm weather are lurking variables.
   - Summer increases ice cream consumption
   - Summer means more people are outside so more murders occur.


Conclusion

- When doing correlations,make a scattergram first to get an idea of strength,direction, and outliers.
- Be careful when calculating r by hand.
- Beware of lurking variables - correlation is not necessarily causation!



Linear Regression and the Coefficient of Determination


Least-Squares Criterion

-  The rule is that the line has to meet the "least squares criterion"

-  "least-squares line"
   - The vertical distances between the dot and the line are squared to get rid of negative sign.
   - These are called "squares"

- The line belongs where it would cause the smallest sum of squares for the whole dataset.


Least-Squares Line Equation

Remember Algebra?

y = bx + a

b = Slope(Rise/Run) , a = y-intercept

We need to find the Least square line.

- Formula l'm using for b
   b = n*sigma(xy) - (sigma(x))(sigma(y))/n*sigma(x^2) - sigma(x)^2
   a = y-bar - b* x-bar


Predicting with the Least Squares Line Equation

Rule About Least Squares Line
 - x-bar and y-bar always fall on the least squares  line - but other points may or may not


Facts About the Slope(b)

- The slope(b) of the least-squares line tells us how many units the response variable(y) is expected to change for each 1 unit of change in the explanatory variable(x).
- For our example: y preidct = 1.1x - 80.0
   - x = DBP, y = # of appointments
   - For each increase in 1 mmHg of DBP(x),there is a 1.1 increase in the number of appointments the patient had over the past year(y)
- The number of units change in the y for each unit change in x is called the "marginal change" in the y.


Influential Points 

- Like with r,if a point is an outlier, it can drastically influence the least squares line equation.
- An extremely high x or extremely low x can do that.
- Always check the scattergram first for outliers.



What is the "Residual"?

Residual = sigma(actual y - predicted y)

- Once the equation is there,you can plug each x in,and get a y-predict out.
- Patient #1
   - (1.1*70) - 80.0 = -3
- Patient #2:
   - (1.1*115) - 80.0 = 46.5

Residual is y minus y-hat(predict)
Patient #1:3 - (-3) = 6
Patient #2:45 - 46.5 = -1.5

Bottom Line: Big residual value means the line did not fit very well.



Using Least Squares Line Equation for Prediction

- Let's say you knew someone's DBP and you wanted to predict how many appointments s/he would have next year.
- You can plug the DBP in as x,and get y-hat out,and say that's your prediction.
- If you use an x within the range of the original equation(70-125),this type of prediction is called interpolation.
- If you use an x from outside the range(such as 65,or 130),it is extrapolation - not a great idea.


Is it Really This Easy to Make Predictions Using the Least Squares Line?

- No.You can make a linear equation out of any x,y pairs.
- If there is no linear correlation,though,the line is meaningless for prediction.
- Imagine a line for this scatterplot-would that really work for prediction?
- To evaluate if our least-squares line equation  is should be used for Interpretation,we use the Coefficient of Determination.




Coefficient of Determination(CD) - r^2

- This is r^2(in other words,r times r)
   - Then,like CV,we turn it into a %
- In the example,our r = 0.95
- 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.90
- CD = 90%
- 90% = explained variation in y(by the linear equation)
- 100% - 90% = 10% unexplained variation
- "90% of the variation in the number of appointments is explained by DBP."
- "10% of the variation in the number of appointments is NOT explained by DBP."
- What happens if the CD is low?
   - Cd should be better than at least 50%(random)
   - The higher,the better
   - If it is low,it means other variables might be needed to explain more of the variation.



Normal Distribution and Empirical Rule


Normal Distribution

Remember Distributions?
- Using quantitative variable
- Classes determined
- Frequency table made
- Frequency histogram
- Then we could see the distribution

Remember the Normal Distribution?

- Imagine a large class(n=100) takes a very difficult test.
- The test is worth 100 points,but it's so hard,no one actually gets 100 points.
- Instead,the mode is near a C grade.


Properties of the Normal Curve

1. The curve is bell-shaped,with the highest point over the mean.
2. The curve is symmetrical around a vertical line through the mean.
3. The curve approaches the horizontal axis but never touches or crosses it.
4. The inflection(transition) points between cupping upward and downward occur at about mean +/- 1 sd.
5. The area under the entire curve is 1(think 100%).



Empirical Rule

Remember Chebyshev?

- Intervals have bountaries, or limits: lower limit and upper limit.
- Remember Chebyshev Intervals?
   - They say,"At least ___% of the data fall in the interval."
   - When lower limit was mue-2(sigma),and upper limit was mue + 2(sigma), at least 75% of the data were in the interval.
- Imagine n = 100 students, mue score on test 65.5, sigma = 14.5
   - Lower limit: 65.5 - (2*14.5) = 36.5
   - Upper limit:65.5 + (2*14.5) = 94.5
   - So if you had 100 data points, at least 75 would be between 36.5 and 94.5.



Chebyshev vs. Empirical Rule

Chebyshev's Theorem 

1. Applies to any distribution
2. Says "at least"
   - between mue +/- 2(sigma),there are AT LEAST 75% of the data.
   - between mue +/- 3(sigma) is at least 88.9%
   - between mue +/- 4(sigma) is at least 93.8%

Empirical Rule

1. Applies to ONLY the normal distribution 
2. Says "approximately"
   - 68% of the data are in interval mue +/- 1(sigma)
   - 95% in interval mue +/- 2(sigma)
   - 99.7%(almost all) in interval mue +/- 3(sigma)

Applying Empirical Rule

mue - 3(sigma) (0.15%) , mue - 2(sigma) (2.35%), mue - 1(sigma) (13.5%),(34%) mue,mue + 1(sigma),mue + 2(sigma),mue + 3(sigma)

   - Remember n=100?
   - 34% of scores are between 51 and 65.5,meaning34 scores.
   - Another 34% (n=34) are between 65.5 and 80.
   - This means 34%+34% = 68% (n=68) are between 51 and 80.

 - The Empirical Rule helps establish intervals that apply to normally distributed data.
 - These intervals have a certain percentage of the data points in them.
 - These intervals depend on the mean and standard deviation of the data distribution.


Z-scores & Probabilities



What is a Z-Score?(Introduction to Standard Normal Distribution)


Remember the Empirical Rule?
   - Required normal distribution
   - Worked well for the cutpoints available
      - What about in-between?
