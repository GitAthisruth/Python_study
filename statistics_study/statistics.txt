Statistics 

- It is the study of how to collect, organize, analyze, and interpret numerical information and data.
- It is both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting information from data.

- It is used to help us make decisions. This is especially important in health care and public health.



Example:CDC & the Flu Vaccine

- During the year, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects,organizes,analyzes, and interprets numerical information and data.

- They extract information from the data and make decisions about what to include in next year's flu vaccine.


Individuals & Variables

Meaning Outside statistics

- Individuals are people.
    - We expect 50 individuals at the graduation.
- A variable is a factor that can vary, possible causing a problem.

    - The time the shop takes with my car is an unknown variable,and i cannot predict it.

eg:time

Meaning in Statistics

- Individuals are people or objects included in a study.
    - 5 individuals could be 5 people,
      5 records, or 5 reports.

- A variable is a characteristic of the individual to be measured or observed.

    - The age of an individual person.
    - The time an individual record was entered.
    - The diagnosis listed on an individual report.


A Few Examples

Individual                               Variables

-Baby born to a mother who              -Birthweight
 smokes cigarettes.
-Urban city                             -Rate of overdose deaths



Concepts in Statistics

- Statistics is used in healthcare and other disciplines to help aid in decision-making.
- Understanding statistics is necessary to understand certain processes in healthcare.


Population Parameter and Sample Statistic


Parameters vs. Statistics

 - What is a population and and what is a sample?
 - Difference between population and sample data
 - Population parameters and sample statistics
 - Examples of parameters and statistics 


 What is a Population?

 Definition

 - A population is a group of people or objects with a common theme.

 - When every member of that group is considered, it is a population.


 Example

 - Theme: Nurses who work at ABC General Hospital(MGH)
 - Population: List from Human Resources of every currently employed nurse at MGH. 

 What is a Sample?

 Definition

 - A sample is a small portion of the population.

 - It can be a representative sample.

 - But it can also be a biased sample.


 Example 

 - Only survey ICU nurses at ABC MGH.
     Not a representative sample
 - At least one nurse from each department.
    - More representative sample.


Population vs Sample data

Population data

- In Population data, data from every individual in the population is available.

- Entire population = census.


Sample data

- In sample data, data is only available from some of the individuals in the population.
- Very commonly used in research studies of patients. 


Examples of Population Data

- Medicare(people age 65 and above are in medicare) Claims Dataset 
    - has all the insurance claims filed by Medicare population.

- United States Census  (conducted every 10 years)


Examples of Sample Data


- The Medicare Beneficiary Survey(MBS) is a survey of a sample of individuals on Medicare.
- American Community Survey(ACS) conducted yearly by the United States Census Bureau.



Statistical Notation


Total Population - N 

Sample of Population - n


Parameter vs. Statistic

A parameter is a measure that describes the entire population.

A statistic is a measure that describes only a sample of a population.


Examples of Parameters & Statistics

Parameter                                      Statistics
                                                
-Mean age of every American on                 - Mean age of Americans on Medicare estimated using the MBS
 Medicare

-The proportion of Americans addicted to       - The proportion of Americans in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) who admit they are addicted to cigarettes.
 cigarettes

-Actual voter turnout                          - The proportion of people in opinion polls who say they plan to vote.




Don't Get Confused!

- When you hear a number on the televisionor radio - do they mention if it is a population parameter or a sample statistic?
- Clues that the number is a population parameter:
  - A dataset was used that encompasses the entire population (like Medicare)
  - Analyses were done by the government or on behalf of the government.

- Clues that number is about a sample statistic:
  - It was from a study recruiting volunteers
  - The report mentions only surveying or measuring a sample of individuals. 

Parameter-Anything that we measure from a population is called parameter.

Statistic-Anything that we measure from a sample is called statistic.




Describing vs. Inferring

Descriptive statistics
- Descriptive statistics involve methods of organizing , picturing, and summarizing information from samples and populations.

Inferential statistics
- Inferential statistics involves methods of using information from a sample to draw conclusions regarding the population.
- Can only used with sample data

Parameters vs. Statistics

- In statistics, it is important to properly identify measures as population parameters or sample statistics.

- Different types of data are used for parameters and statistics.



Classifying Levels of Measurement(Four-level system)


Classifying Variables 

 - Quantitative vs. qualitative(categorical) data

    - Interval vs. ratio data
    - Nominal vs. ordinal data

 -  Examples of how to classify healthcare data


Four-level Data Classification

 (Human Research Data)

Quantitative(Continuous)  vs     Qualitative(categorical)


Quantitative(Continuous)

 - Quantitative is a numerical measurement of something.eg:temperature

 Examples of Quantitative Variables in Healthcare:

  - Time of admit

  - Year of diagnosis

  - Systolic blood pressure(SBP)

  - Platelet count

We can split  Quantitative data into:
 - Interval vs. Ratio 


 Interval 

 - Quantitative(continuous) data
    -Differences between data values are meaningful.

    - There is no true zero.
      - Interval = there is no true zero.
        - "Time" cannot have a true zero
            - Time of admit = 8:09 
            - Year of diagnosis = 1999

 Ratio 

  - Quantitative(continuous) data

  - Differences between data values are meaningful

  - There is a true zero. 

    - Ratio = there is a true zero.
        - if you are dead, you have a SBP(Systolic blood pressure) = 0
        - Same is true with platelet count







Qualitative(categorical)

- Qualitative refers to a "quality" or categorical characteristics of something eg:gender.

 Examples of Qualitative Variables in Healthcare:

  - Type of health insurance

  - Country of origin 

  - Stage of cancer

  - Trauma center level

   - Nominal = Cannot be ordered 

   - Ordinal = natural order 
     - Differences between levels is meaningless

We can split  Qualitative data into:
 - Nominal vs. ordinal


 Nominal 

  - Nominal applies to categories,labels or names, and cannot be ordered from smallest to largest.

   eg: country ,gender , race, hair color

Ordinal

  - Ordinal applies to data that can be arranged in order in categories,

    - but the difference between data values cannot be determined, or is meaningless.

    eg: ordinal data includes having a position in class as "First" or "Second".



Classifying Variables

 - All data can be classified as quantitative(continuous) or qualitative(categorical).

 - Data can be further classified as interval,ratio,nominal, or ordinal.

 - It is important to know how to classify data in healthcare.



Sampling 


Sampling Definition

Concepts in Sampling

 - What is a "sample"?

 - Sampling frames, and errors in representing sampling frames.

 - Summary of definitions presented.
   

Sampling and Samples 

 - We take a sample of the population because we want to do "inferential statistics"
    - We want to infer from the sample to the population.

 - Reasons not to measure the whole population
    - Impractical 
    - Unnecessary


Sampling Frames

 - List of individuals from which a sample is actually selected.

 - "List" may be a physical,concrete listed
    - List of students enrolled at a nursing college

 - May be a theoretical list not made up yet
    - List of patients who will present to the Emergency Department today.


 - Sampling frame is the part of the population from which you want to draw a sample.

Therefore, you want everyone from your sampling frame to have a chance of being selected for your sample.



Undercoverage

What is it?

 - Omitting population members from the sampling frame(list of members in population used for sampling).

How can it happen?

 - List of nursing students may not include everyone for administrative reasons.

 - People who present to the Emergency Department at night might be different than those in the day.



Errors in Statistics

Fact-of-Life Error

 - Sampling errors

    - The population mean will probably be different from your sample mean.

    - The population percentage will probably be different from your sample percentage.


Cause of Error

 - Sampling error - caused by the fact that, regardless of what you do, your sample will not perfectly represent the population.


Error you want to Avoid

 - Non-sampling error
    - Using a bad list.
    - Make sure that you pay careful attention that everyone in the population who is supposed to be represented in your sampling frame is in there!

Cause of Error
 - Non-sampling error - caused by poor sample design, sloppy data collection, inaccurate measurement instruments, bias in data collection, other problems introduced by the researcher.


Simulation

 - A simulation is defined as a "numerical facsimile or representation of a real-world phenomenon."

 - It is a essentially working through a pretend situation to see how it would come out in the case it was real. 


Concepts in Sampling 

 - it is important to do your best to avoid non-sampling error

 - This is achieved by making sure you do not have undercoverage when sampling from your sampling frame.


Simple Random Sampling

Definition 

 - "A simple random sample of n measurements from a population is a subset of the population selected in such a manner that every sample of size n from the population has an equal chance of being selected".

Example

 - You have a list of the population of students in a class.

 - You want to take a sample of 5 (n=5).

 -  If you take a simple random sample (SRS) from the class list, it means all the different possible  groups of 5 students you could pick from the list has an equal chance of being the sample (group) you actually pick.



One method of SRS


 - Number all of the individuals in the population with a unique number.
    - Like student ID number

 - Put all the student ID numbers in a place from which you can draw randomly without looking(like a hat)

 - Draw 5 ID's and use those students as your sample.


Another method of SRS

    - Generate a list of random numbers as long as the list of the population.

    - Randomly assign these numbers to the population in the list.

    - Take the first 5 numbers(whoever gets assign 1 through 5).


SRS Means Equal Chance of Being selected

 - First method: old-fashioned "hat"
 - Second method: Electronic "hat"
 - In both methods, all members of the population had an equal probability of being selected into the sample.


Limits of Simple Random Sampling

  - You need a list
    - You don't know who will present at the Emergency Department that day, how do you sample?
    - Okay when a list is available.

  - You need a good list

    - Otherwise, you risk undercoverage
    - What if part-time  students were not on the list?
    - Non-sampling error



Stratified Sampling 


What is Stratified Sampling?

 - First, the list is divided into groups, or strata.

 - This is a way to make it so that there are certain proportions of groups in the final sample.

 - Next,simple random sampling(SRS) takes place for each of the strate.



Steps in Stratified Sampling

 - Divide entire population into distinct subgroups called strata.
 - The strata are based on a specific characteristic, such as age, income,education level, and so on.
 - All members of a stratum share this specific characteristic.
 - Draw an SRS from each stratum. 


Examples of Stratified Sampling

 - In a high school, sampling so many students from each of the grades(freshman,sophomore,junior,senior)

 - In hospitals, sampling so many patients or providers from department(different intensive care units).


Limitations of Stratified  Sampling

 - Oversampling one group(strata) means your summary statistic is unbalanced.

 - It is not possible to do without a list beforehand(like with SRS).

 - It is also hard because you have to split the list into groups("strata") then SRS from strata.


Stratified Sampling 

 - Stratified = taken from groups.
 - Several steps are involved.
 - Useful if necessary to make all strata equal, or to sample from groups that are small in the large population.


Systematic Sampling
